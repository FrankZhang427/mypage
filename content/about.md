description: Who is Frank Zhang?
---

My name is Zhiguo Zhang, also known as Frank. I was born in [Dongying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongying), China. I grew up in Dongying and went to McGill University for a Bachelor of Science degree in Honours Statistics and Computer Science, plus a Minor in Finance. Recently in February 2020, I obtained my Master of Science degree from [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University under the supervision of Professor [Paul G. Kry](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kry/).  My research interests are in computer graphics and animation, modern computer games, and applied machine learning. Currently, I'm a Java Trainee at [FDM Group](https://www.fdmgroup.com/).

In my spare time, I like sketching, practicing Chinese calligraphy, and cooking for my family.
