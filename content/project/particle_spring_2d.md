## Abstract

The goal of this project is to implement the idea of particle-spring system in 2D. The position and velocity of each particle at each time step are updated by symplectic Euler integrator. Collision detection and impulse response are also implemented. Several test cases are given in the application. An amusing pinball-puzzle is created based on this system.


## Pinball-Puzzle

A pinball-puzzle is simulated in real time. Here is a sample puzzle. Users can modify the puzzle the way they want.
